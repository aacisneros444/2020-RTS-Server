# 2020-RTS-Server
Repository for a real-time strategy game server prototype I made during the latter part of my senior year of high school (spring 2020/pandemic times). Made with Unity Engine's Data-Oriented Tech Stack.

Didn't know much about good programming style and habits at this time, and it definitely shows!
Was a fun project though, and I learned a lot about what goes into making a real-time app utilizing a client-server architecture.
